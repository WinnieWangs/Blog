# Difference Between Promise and Async/Await

*If you’re reading this, you probably understand how the promise and async/await are different in the execution context.*

In JavaScript, promises and async/await are two different ways to handle asynchronous operations. But they are **closely related.**

## **Promise**

A promise is an object that eventually leads to an **asynchronous operation’s** completion or failure. A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected. When the asynchronous operation is completed, the Promise will either be **fulfilled** with a ***value*** or **rejected** with an **error.**

```js
// Using Promises
function promiseFunction() {
  return  new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("Resolved");
  }, 2000);
})
}

console.log("Start");
promiseFunction()
.then((result) => {
  console.log(result);
  console.log("End");
})
.catch((error)=>{
console.log(error)
});

Output:
Start
Resolved
End
```

## **Async/Await**

Async/await is a  **syntactic sugar on top of promises** . It provides a more concise way to write asynchronous code, making it easier to read and write. With Async/Await, you can write asynchronous code that looks similar to synchronous code, and **it uses promises under the hood.**

In async/await, the `<strong class="lw fp">async</strong>` *keyword is used to declare an asynchronous function** . The `<strong class="lw fp">await</strong>` keyword is used to wait for a promise to be resolved before continuing with the execution of the function. The `await` keyword can only be used inside an `async` function.

```js
// Using Async/Await
async function asyncFunction() {
  try {
    console.log("Start");
    const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        resolve("Resolved");
      }, 2000);
    });
    const result = await promise;
    console.log(result);
    console.log("End");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

asyncFunction()

output:
Start
Resolved
End
```

## **Difference**

The only difference is the **execution context** between promise and async/await.

When a Promise is created and the  **asynchronous operation is started** , the code after the  **Promise creation continues to execute synchronously** . When the Promise is resolved or rejected **, the attached callback function is added to the microtask queue. The microtask queue is processed after the current task has been completed but before the next task is processed from the task queue** . This means that any code that follows the creation of the Promise will execute before the callback function attached to the Promise is executed.

On the other hand, with Async/Await, the `await` keyword causes the JavaScript engine to pause the execution of the `async` function until the Promise is resolved or rejected. While the *`<strong class="lw fp">async</strong>`  *function waits for the Promise to resolve, it does not block the call stack, and any other synchronous code can be executed** . Once the Promise is resolved, the execution of the `async` function resumes, and the result of the Promise is returned. If rejected, it throws an error value.
